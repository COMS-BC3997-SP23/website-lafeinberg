+ Fine tune the Fi2Pop Algorithm
+ Work as a group with the REVOLVE team on hardware
+ Find other EAs to run and modify
+ More research papers!88

# What can I help with?
+ I've spent way too much trying to figure out Jekyll, so I can try to help with that
+ Java, Python, C++
+ I have found a lot of databases for interesting research on EAs and robotics -- I can share!
+ Nothing much, sorry!

# What I need help with

+ I am a bit confused with pictures on Jekyll
+ I don't know how to get rid of the extraneous information (as seen below)
+ Types and proof reading
